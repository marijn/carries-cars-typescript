# Carries Cars Sandbox and Examples in Typescript

A sandbox with examples of domain modelling approaches in Typescript.
The purpose of these examples is to inspire you with different styles, not to dictate how it is supposed to be done.

Having a simple playground allows us to remain focussed on the problem that we want to tackle:
Learning to implement domain models in code.

## A notice about repository layout

At this point in time this repository does NOT reflect a desirable layout.
Right now the only models in focus are the ones part of the domain layer.
This is to force us to focus only on domain modelling.
